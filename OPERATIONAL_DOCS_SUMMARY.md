## 🎯 Key Features

### Command-Oriented Approach

Every procedure includes exact commands to run:

```bash
# Example: Site Down Response
curl -I https://dobeu.net
netlify status
netlify rollback
```

### Failure Mode Coverage

**7 Major Failure Modes Documented:**

1. **Site Down / 500 Errors** (P0)
   - Symptoms, triage, root causes, mitigation
2. **Authentication Failures** (P1)
   - Auth0 issues, token problems, CORS errors
3. **Database Connection Failures** (P1)
   - Supabase Postgres (db-dobeutech-unified) issues, connection pool, certificates
4. **Build Failures** (P2)
   - Dependency conflicts, TypeScript errors, memory issues
5. **Function Timeouts** (P1)
   - Slow queries, payload issues, optimization
6. **High Error Rate** (P1)
   - Recent deploy issues, CSP violations, rate limiting
7. **Performance Degradation** (P2)
   - Bundle size, slow queries, CDN cache

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Complete monitoring setup for:**

- Netlify (deploys, functions, bandwidth)
- Supabase Postgres (db-dobeutech-unified) (connections, queries, performance)
- PostHog (errors, sessions, user behavior)
- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot/Pingdom)
- Custom health checks

**Alert severity levels:**

- P0: Immediate response (PagerDuty + Slack + Email)
- P1: < 15 min response (Slack + Email)
- P2: < 1 hour response (Slack)
- P3: Next day response (Email)
